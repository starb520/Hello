# Overview
Think of the satisfaction you feel at finding the answer to a problem or putting in the final piece of a jigsaw puzzle. There is a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment when we solve problems or complete challenging tasks. As a software engineer, and with technology in general, there are an unlimited number of problems to solve and challenges to conquer. I don't want to just solve the problem. I want to solve problems in the most efficient, maintainable, and user friendly way. 

This Hello World program uses Python and the Visual Studio Code IDE to display the message "Hello World!" to a user.

The purpose for creating this software is to show the first step in almost every programmers learning journey, displaying a phrase to the screen for a user to view. It demonstrates the ability of people to use a computer's language to communicate an idea.
